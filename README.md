# 26: Frontend Tooling & React

###### travis will be integrated in future labs, not for hello world lab

## Overview

A "Moo World" react-app via cowsay-browser API.

#### Web features

In order to learn and demonstrate basic state with react, here are the working web features I setup:

1. Generate a new moo message
2. console.log current state of moo message (open chrome/moz devtools to see it)
3. Select the cow of your choice
4. increment / decrement counter

### How To

##### Start react app and refresh actively

```
npm run watch
```

### Tests Performed with Jest

###### testing app.js

##### myfile.js

###### jest tests required for future labs, not moo world lab

### Built With

React, ES6, babel, eslint, etc.
